Welcome to **The World of Open Source**, where your ideas and contributions count and are highly appreciated.

## Project Brief

To ease the process of the community website project, a [mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/N8ef18pNNEN6Hkht2r44nZ/Chryz-hub?node-id=126%3A22) has been designed. Please, follow the design while contributing to the project.

To contribute to the community website project, open the `src` directory which contains all the assets you'll need. Also, the `index.html` file is in the root directory and not in the `src` directory, take note.

## Getting Started 

> If you've never made a pull request before, or participated in an open-source project, we recommend taking a look at our [opensource-4-everyone repository](https://github.com/chryz-hub/opensource-4-everyone#simple-guide-to-making-a-pull-request-or-contribution). This repo has everything you need to learn about open-source, with a step-by-step guide to making your very first PR. Once you've got your hands dirty, you're ready to come back and dive into Community Website Project.

1. First up you need to fork (make a copy) of this repo to your Github account.

1. Clone (download) your fork to your computer

1. Set your streams so you can sync your clone with the original repo (get the latest updates)

   - `git remote add upstream https://github.com/chryz-hub/chryz-hub.github.io.git`
   - `git pull upstream master`
   - The above 2 commands will synchronize your forked version of the project with the actual repository.

1. Find a task/issue [here](https://github.com/chryz-hub/chryz-hub.github.io/issues) or [create a task](https://github.com/chryz-hub/chryz-hub.github.io/issues/new/choose)

   - Comment on the task to claim it, ensuring no body has done so already. Saying, I like to work on this task/issue.

   - If you created a new task or issue, ensure you specify if you are undertaking the task or if someone else is able to claim it.

   - Keep the issue updated with your progress, inactive issues will be reassigned.

1. Create a branch for your task and complete the task

   - `git checkout -b <your branch name>`

1. Pull from the upstream again, like we did in step 3. This is to insure we still have the latest code.

   - `git pull upstream master`

1. Commit and push the code to your fork

   - `git add .`
   - `git commit -m "I've fixed this issue #issue_number"`
   - `git push <your branch name>`

1. Create a pull request to have the changes merged into the origin

   - Ensure you add to the comments of the pull request fixes #<issue number>, replacing with the number of you issue will automatically close the issue when the pull request is merged.
